## Overview

The employee directory is a full front-end react application that allows users at a company to quicly find and view data about their co-workers. Utilize the search bar to find speicifc employees quickly. Search results will dynamically narrow as a name is typed.

## The Project

### User Story

The user story behind this project was: "As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information."

### Goals

The goals of this project included: braking the applications UI into components, managing component state, and responding to user events. I was able to accomplish all of these goals, and even decided to convert all of my class componets to functional components and use react hooks.

### Details

The API used to fetch all of the user data was: randomuser.me.
